Gox is a Go XMPP library, focusing on simplicity, simple automation, and IoT.

The goal is to make simple to write simple adhoc XMPP clients:

- For automation (like for example monitoring of an XMPP service),
- For building connected "things" by plugging them on an XMPP server,
- For writing simple chatbot to control a service or a thing.
