# TODO

## Issues

- Remove global variable (like mucToleave)
- Does not report error when trying to connect to a non open port (for example localhost with no server running).

## Features

- configuration
  - allow unencrypted
  - skip tls verification
- support muc and single user at same time
- send html -> parse console colors to xhtml (is there a easy way or lib for it ?)
